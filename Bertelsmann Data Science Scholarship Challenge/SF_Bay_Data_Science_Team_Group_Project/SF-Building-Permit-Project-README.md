Background:

This was an extra credit group project for the Udacity Bertelsmann Data Science Scholarship Challenge.  In this project, I worked remotely with other students in the SF Bay area to analyze a Kaggle dataset of SF permit applications (dataset link below).

My contributions to the project included:
1.	Organized weekly online meet ups.
2.	Cleaned the data using Python/Pandas so the team could analyze it.
3.	Created slide #3 of the presentation - analyzed the number of permits issued, wait times, and project costs by neighborhood, and created the visualization in Tableau.
4.	Help the other students find key insights from their data.
5.	Put together the Google Slides presentation.
